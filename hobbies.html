        <p>Since the game has started I have played World of Warcraft off 
            and on, but my favorite character is the paladin.</p> 
        <p>Because the paladin wears heavy armor and can heal himself, and 
        I like to solo play, a paladin is a one man army.</p>
        <p>Also, the armor depicted in this photo is my favorite armor for my character to wear</p>
